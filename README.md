- if everything goes right , the window will appear
- using **middle mouse** provide a *starting point* and the *ending point* of the agortihm
- (optional) using **left mouse** (dragging) provide some *obstacles* for the algorithm
- (optional) using **right mouse** (dragging) the *obstacles* can be *removed*
